This project will be attached to hook 16090 (Pre-print report hook)

It will run from the Print Button on the quote header screen. The code will expect additional text on the user 1 field, from the user fields button on the quote header scree.
When clicking on the print button, the project will ask if the quote should be printed, saved, or both. 
If clicking on print, the code will terminate and the print procedure will continue as normal.
If clicking on save, the code will ask the user for a save location if it successfully finds additional text in the user 1 field of the quote header. It will then tell the program to not print the report on screen and save a pdf version of the quote in the selected location.
If clicking on both, the process will be the same for the save, with the exception that it will allow the program to print the quote on screen as usual.
The format of the file name that is saved is #xxx@@@@@, where the x's represent the quote number without leading zeroes, and the @'s represent the additional text stored in the User 1 field for the quote.

Update:

Logged in with the customer and they changed specs. They are now only worried about sending emails with the Quote attached as a PDF with the filename format “DoverMEI Quote ####” The files for this are in the “Update” folder. It is a modification of ATG_4136_Email_Quote_Pdf.gas and it is now attached to hook 10850.
